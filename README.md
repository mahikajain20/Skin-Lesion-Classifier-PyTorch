# Skin Lesion Classification using PyTorch and Stanford DDI Dataset

Final Project Lighthouse Labs (Data Science)

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying skin lesions using the Stanford Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. We'll be using PyTorch to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this binary classification task.

The goal is to accurately distinguish between two classes of skin lesions, which can aid in early detection and diagnosis of skin conditions. This project will explore various aspects of deep learning, including data preparation, model architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning.

Key objectives:
1. Preprocess and analyze the DDI dataset
2. Design and implement a CNN using PyTorch
3. Train and evaluate the model using various techniques
4. Compare different model architectures and hyperparameters
5. Analyze results 
6. Deploy the model and provide recommendations for future work

## 2. Data Description

The Stanford Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset is used for this project. It consists of diverse skin lesion images categorized into two classes. The dataset aims to provide a more inclusive representation of skin conditions across different skin types and ethnicities.

Dataset characteristics:
- Source: Stanford University
- Number of classes: 2
- Image format: [Specify format, e.g., JPEG, PNG]
- Image dimensions: [Specify dimensions, e.g., 224x224 pixels]
- Total number of images: [Specify total count]
- Class distribution: [Provide breakdown of images per class]

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure proper model evaluation and prevent overfitting.
